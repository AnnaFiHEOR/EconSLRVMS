## Review question
Key question – what is the economic evidence and quality of life of interventions for the management of moderate-to- severe VMS associated with menopause? 

Specific questions are listed below:

* What methods and data have been used t- model the published economic evaluations/models for the moderate-to- severe VMS associated with menopause?
* What cost and resource groups, estimates and data sources have been used t- assess the costs for the treatment of moderate-to-severe VMS associated with menopause?
* What utility inputs, estimates and valuations have been used t- assess the utilities associated with moderate-to-severe VMS in menopause?
* What was the impact of the treatments and VMS on the quality of life and patient reported outcomes for the treatment of moderate-to-severe VMS associated with menopause?

Relevant systematic reviews will be included t- identify the unique studies not identified from the electronic database searching
## Types of studies t- be included
Study designs of the following types will be included if reporting relevant outcomes:
- RCTs
- Observational studies (cross-sectional surveys, case-control studies, retrospective and prospective studies - Model based and non-model based studies
- Technical reports
## Condition or domain being studied
Moderate-to-severe VMS associated with menopause
## Participants/population
Inclusion criteria: Female, adult patients experiencing VMS associated with the menopause (incl. peri- and postmenopausal women)
Exclusion criteria: Male population or women not experiencing VMS associated with menopause
## Intervention(s), exposure(s)
All relevant pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies such as (but not limited to): 
- Hormonal therapies
- Antidepressants
- Non-pharmacological such as acupressure, alternative medicine, cognitive therapy etc.
- Systemic therapies such as clonidine, gabapentin, SERM, neurokinin/tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists
## Comparator(s)/control
N- restrictions
## Main outcome(s)
Economic evaluations:
- Model context, interventions/comparators, perspective and timeframe
- Outcomes and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) (incremental costs/quality adjusted life years [QALY]/life years [LY])
Cost & resource use:
- Direct costs
- Indirect costs QoL/utilities:
- Utilities and disutilities (absolute and change in utility values): (EQ-5D, HUI, SF-6D, standard gamble, time-trade off)
- Patient reported outcomes (PRO) measures
## Additional outcome(s)
Economic evaluations:
- Model structure and health states
- Model inputs (specification, estimates and data sources)
- Including but not limited t- measurement and sources of effectiveness, safety, cost data, resource use data, utility, health states
Model assumptions
- Discounting
- Analyses of uncertainty with respective outcomes
Cost & resource use: 
- Unit costs
- Intangible costs
- Total costs
- Resource use
QoL/utilities:
- Patient reported outcomes (PRO) measures:
- Hot Flashes: hot flash daily diaries, night time awakenings and night sweats; frequency, severity, change scores; hot flash related daily interference scale
- Disease-specific HRQoL estimates: MENQoL, Green Climacteric Scale, WHQ, Menopause Rating Scale - Sleep disturbance and quality: PROMIS SD, ISI, PSQI
- Generic HRQoL and other assessments: SF36, PGI-C and PGI-S, Beck Depression Inventory, FSFI
## Data extraction (selection and coding) 
Study selection
- Records will be screened in line with the expected needs of global HTA submission templates (NICE etc.) by tw- independent reviews
- Screening will be performed in tw- stages with title/abstract screening in the first stage followed by full text screening of the articles
- Any disagreements will be adjudicated by a third reviewer
- Decisions will be recorded in Excel
Data extractions
- Data will be extracted in line with the expected needs of global HTA submission templates (NICE etc.) by one independent review. All extracted data will be quality checked against the original source article by a senior reviewer.
- Data extractions will be performed in Excel based worksheet
- The key information t- be captured in the extraction grid is presented below (a non-exhaustive list)
- Study characteristics (country/location, setting, study design, study methods, source of funding, competing interest, etc.)
- Patient characteristics (inclusion/exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics, etc.) - Type of intervention
- Model summary (including perspective, analytical approach, reference year, time horizon and discounting) and structure
- Assumptions underpinning model structures
- Sources and methods of clinical, cost and quality of life inputs
- Description of health states/utilities (along with details of instrument used)
- Summary health outcomes (e.g. quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] and life years gained) - Direct, indirect and total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis
- Analyses of uncertainty and results of sensitivity analyses
- Resource consumption
- Utility/disutility data (EQ-5D, HUI, SF-6D, standard gamble, time-trade off etc.)
- HRQoL evidence and outcomes (Hot Flash Daily Diary, PROMIS SD, SF36, MENQOL, PGI-S and PGI-C, EQ-5D, ISI, Menopause Rating Scale, Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ), FSFI, PSQI and BDI-II)
## Risk of bias (quality) assessment
- For all the included economic evaluation studies, study quality will be assessed using the checklists adapted from Drummond and Jefferson which is universally accepted for HTA submissions, including NICE.
- The included utility studies will be critically appraised using the Papaioannou checklist.
- Quality assessment will be completed for each study by one reviewer and quality checked by a senior reviewer.
- The assessment will be done at study level.
- For the QoL and PR- outcomes, studies will be critically appraised for reporting quality using the checklist depending upon the associate study designs:
- For RCTs, standard NICE checklist will be used t- determine the overall quality - For non-RCTs and observational studies, Downs’ and Black checklist will be used
## Strategy for data synthesis
- The results of studies will be synthesized qualitatively and reported separately for economic evaluations, cost/resource use, utilities, and PROs and HRQoL.
- A systematic narrative synthesis will be provided with information presented in the text and tables t- summarize and explain the characteristics and findings of the included studies
- The narrative synthesis will explore the relationship and findings both within and between the included studies, in line with the guidance from the York CRD and ESRC Methods program for narrative synthesis for writing systematic review
- The guidance from the standard PRISMA checklist 2020 will be used for data reporting
## Analysis of subgroups or subsets
Potential subgroups may include but are not limited to:
- Patients with a history of breast cancer or other hormone dependent tumor
- Family history of breast cancer
- Patients with active or history of venous thromboembolic disease or arterial thromboembolic disease or known thrombophilic disorders
- At risk of venous thromboembolism (e.g. BMI>30 kg/m2)
- Women wh- have previously tried a hormonal method or contraindicated/intolerance t- HT due t- obesity or smoking
